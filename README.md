## About

GitHub Action to synchronize docker images between container registries or
inside the same registry. Because some registries enforce increasingly stricter
pull limits a distributed availability of images can reduce problems with limit
hits. The action uses [regclient](https://github.com/regclient/regclient) to
fetch the available tags of a source repository and copies them to a target
repository. A glob-based filter for the tags can be applied. Regclient will skip
any layers that are already present in the target repository.

The action can also be used to copy images within the same registry.

## Usage

### Prerequisites

The action relies on the availability of `regclient` (`regctl` as the CLI
interface) on the runner. It has to be set up before the action is executed. A
registry login might be required as well. It can be done before the action is
executed like below or by the action itself.

```yaml
jobs:
  sync-images:
    name: Sync images from DockerHub to GHCR
    runs-on: ubuntu-24.04
    steps:
      - name: Install regctl
        uses: regclient/actions/regctl-installer@main
```

#### Authentication

The login to the registries can be done in two ways: 1) with docker and 2) with
regclient.

##### Docker login

```yaml
jobs:
  sync-images:
    name: Sync images from DockerHub to GHCR
    runs-on: ubuntu-24.04
    steps:
      # ...
      - name: Login to DockerHub
        uses: regclient/actions/regctl-login@main
        with:
          registry: docker.io
          username: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_USERNAME }}
          password: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_TOKEN }}

      - name: Login to GHCR
        uses: regclient/actions/regctl-login@main
        with:
          registry: ghcr.io
          username: ${{ github.actor }}
          password: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

##### regclient login
