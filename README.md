## About

GitHub Action to synchronize docker images between container registries. Because
some registries enforce increasingly stricter pull limits a distributed
availability of images can reduce problems with limit hits. The action uses
[regclient](https://github.com/regclient/regclient) to fetch the available tags
of a source repository and copies them to a target repository. A glob-based
filter for the tags can be applied. Regclient will skip any layers that are
already present in the target repository.

## Usage

### Prerequisites

The action relies on the availability of `regclient` (`regctl` as the CLI
interface) on the runner. It has to be set up before the action is executed. A
registry login might be required as well. RegClient provides actions to install
it and to login it into a registry.

```yaml
jobs:
  sync-images:
    name: Sync images from DockerHub to GHCR
    runs-on: ubuntu-24.04
    steps:
      - name: Install regctl
        uses: regclient/actions/regctl-installer@main

      - name: Login to DockerHub
        uses: regclient/actions/regctl-login@main
        with:
          registry: docker.io
          username: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_USERNAME }}
          password: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_TOKEN }}

      - name: Login to GHCR
        uses: regclient/actions/regctl-login@main
        with:
          registry: ghcr.io
          username: ${{ github.actor }}
          password: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

The login to DockerHub is optional but recommended to prevent the mentioned pull
rate limiting issues. On the other hand, the login to the GitHub Container
Registry is mandatory to push the images.

| tags                 | Glob pattern to filter which tags to sync (e.g., 'v*' for version tags, '*-stable' for stable tags) based on DockerHub tags | no       | '\*'    |
| regClientConcurrency | Number of concurrent regclient copy operations                                                                              | no       | 2       |

### Example

```yaml
jobs:
  sync-images:
    name: Sync images from DockerHub to GHCR
    runs-on: ubuntu-24.04
    steps:

      - name: Sync images
        uses: it-bens/container-registry-sync-action@main
